# sql-data-cleaning-project on nashville housing dataset.

In this project my main focus was to clean the raw data to make it more usable and presentable for  analysis.

The main data cleaning tasks which involved here was:-
 ---changing datetime into date datatype
 ---Populate property_address using inner joins
 ---seperating complete address into individual columnns(Address,City,State) using SUBSTRING AND CHARINDEX function.
 ---seperated owners address into different columns using Parsename function
 ---Removed dublicate values using windows function and CTE.
 ---used case function in vacant column to look more presentable.
 ---removed unused columns
